I've gone through the first unit of the Security+ study objectives thanks to the notorious Professor Messer's notes and in depth videos. My goal is to take the exam in April, and the motivation stemmed from learning about the vast amount of tech roles available in the government tech space (GovTech). In addition to studying CS, it is fun learning how cybersecurity can be intertwined with the technicality of software engineering as I'm learning about operating systems on my spare time.

The motivation stemmed from coming across Symone B. Beez's videos on YouTube, because she is an advocate and longtime expert in the GovTech space. One of her top advice is to get the Security+ while in school, because it is one of the best certifications at the entry level and one of the most sought after in the government space when looking to start out. A majority of prospects like myself expect to start in a big tech company, or even one of the big startups. I think it is awesome to have ambitious goals but there are so many different types of roles and companies to think of, because technology is pretty much a universal sector and applies to every business you can think of. Personally, I still practice Leetcode and DSA even though I may not expect to land at a FAANG company, but that is mostly because I sort of enjoy the challenge.
